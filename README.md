I chose to make this game because it's a very simple cards game that even children play in all TheSpanish-speaking world, however there are no electronic versions of it.

A simple two-players card game
It is a game for two players.
It starts with five cards being dealt to each player.
The goal is to run out of cards at the end. To open the game, a card is placed face up. Each player throws one card of the same suit (if you don't have one, you must draw from the deck until you get one), looking for the biggest card and win that hand, which gives you the right to throw first in the second hand and establish the suit in which everyone must play in the next round. As the hands go by, the player who manages to run out of cards wins.
